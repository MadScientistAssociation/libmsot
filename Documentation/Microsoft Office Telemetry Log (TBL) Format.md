# 1.0 Overview

The Microsoft Office telemetry agent was first introduced in 2013 with the release of Office 2013. It is used to collect data from various Microsoft Office applications, including Access, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Publisher, Visio, and Word. Information collected will depend on the version of Office and the telemetry agent installed, as detailed in section 1.2. Typical data collection will include user name, computer name, filename, document title and author, and last loaded date[1].

Telemetry agent data is initially stored locally the %UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Telemetry\ folder. Depending on the deployment configuration, it may then be uploaded to a network share and processed into a SQL database.

# 1.2 Timestamps

TBL files store timestamps using the Windows NT (win32 epoch) time format, represented as the number of 100 nanosecond intervals since 01/01/1601 00:00:00 UTC[2]. The timestamps are stored as a 64-bit value.

# 1.3 Text Encoding

Unless other specified, all text contained in TBL files is encoded as UTF-16 little-endian.
