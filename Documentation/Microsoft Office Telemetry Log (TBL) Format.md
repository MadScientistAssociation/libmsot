## 1. Overview

The Microsoft Office telemetry agent was first introduced in 2013 with the release of Office 2013. It is used to collect data from various Microsoft Office applications, including Access, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Publisher, Visio, and Word. Information collected will depend on the version of Office and the telemetry agent installed, as detailed in section 1.2. Typical data collection will include user name, computer name, filename, document title and author, and last loaded date[1].

Telemetry agent data is initially stored locally the %UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Telemetry\ folder. Depending on the deployment configuration, it may then be uploaded to a network share and processed into a SQL database.

### 1.1 Test Version

The following versions of programs were used to test the information in this document:

* Microsoft Windows 10 Professional v. 1803
* Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2
* Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Standard Service Pack 2
* Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016

### 1.2 Timestamps

TBL files store timestamps using the Windows NT (win32 epoch) time format, represented as the number of 100 nanosecond intervals since 01/01/1601 00:00:00 UTC[2]. The timestamps are stored as a 64-bit value.

### 1.3 Text Encoding

Unless other specified, all text contained in TBL files is encoded as UTF-16 little-endian.

## 2. File Structure

### 2.1 Header

TBL files start with a 16-byte signature, divided into two 8-byte segments. The first segment is common across TBL files, while the second defines the TBL as containing either user data (user.tbl), event data (evt.tbl), or solution data (sln.tbl). The header is the *only* section of the TBL file utilizing UTF-8 text encoding.

| Offset | Size (b) | Value (hex)      | Value (UTF-8) |Description |
| ---    | ---      | ---              | ---           | ---        |
|0       | 8        | 2000000053444454 | ...SDDT       | Signature  |

|8       | 8        | 01000000564E4953 | ...VNIS       | sln.tbl    |

### 2.2 user.tbl

The user.tbl file contains information about the user under which the telemetry agent is running, the network to which the machine is joined, and details on the hardware on the underlying machine.

Numeric values in the table below are stored as 16-bit little-endian unsigned integers unless otherwise noted.
