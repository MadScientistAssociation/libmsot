# Microsoft Office Telemetry Parser

## Overview

In Office 2013, Microsoft introduced telemetry collection in Office. This created a gold mine of data for digital forensics examiners.

Included in Office telemetry collection are:
* File name
* User name
* File open/close date/times
* File size
* Document title
* Document author
* Office version
* Last loaded date/times

MSOTParser.py is a parser for the binary files sln.tbl, user.tbl, and evt.tbl. It combines the data from these 3 files and outputs a csv report.

## Compatibility

This project is primarily intended for use with Python 3.6 and greater. However, to facilitate compatibility with Autopsy, there is a Python 2.7 backport in the 27_Backport folder.

## Usage

`python MSOTParser.py <sln.tbl> <evt.tbl> <user.tbl> <output.csv>`
